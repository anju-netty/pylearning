lenth of string
length of search_Str

slider, starting will be 0
slider , end will be length of search_Str.

iteration will start at 0 and stop when the end pointer of the slider reaches the end of string.

Alternative is using, split the str to chunks of the length of the search_Str and then compare the list
items to the search_Str. But it is not efficient as it takes memory.
